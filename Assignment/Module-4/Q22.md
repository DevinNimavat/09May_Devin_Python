How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of 
A Python Class 


Ans-> 

To define a class, use the class keyword followed by the class name and a colon.

self allows you to access and modify attributes and call methods within that instance.

EX.

class test:
    a=40
    b=50

    def data(self):
        print(f'Sum of A + B: {self.a + self.b}')

result=test()

result.data()

#Output: Sum of A + B: 90
